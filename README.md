# Radioactive Decay Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the process of radioactive decay using the Euler method. It explores both single-nucleus and multi-nucleus decay models, comparing numerical results to analytical solutions and evaluating the error for different time steps.

### Features

1. **Single-Nucleus Decay Simulation**:
   - Simulates the decay of a single type of radioactive atom.
   - Compares the numerical results of the Euler method with the analytical solution.
   - Analyzes the relative error for different time steps (\(\Delta t\)).
   - Plots the abundance of atoms over time and the associated errors.

2. **Multi-Nuclei Decay Model (ABC Model)**:
   - Simulates a three-nuclei system where one nucleus decays into another.
   - Uses various half-life values for different nuclei in the system.
   - Displays the abundance of nuclei \(A(t)\), \(B(t)\), and \(C(t)\) over time.
   - Compares simulations for different half-lives of nuclei \(A\) and \(B\).

### Visualization

- **Single-Nucleus Simulation**:
  - Plots showing the abundance of radioactive atoms over time for different time steps.
  - Plots showing the relative error in the simulations for different time steps.
  
- **Three-Nuclei Simulation (ABC Model)**:
  - Side-by-side plots showing the evolution of the three-nuclei system for different half-lives of nuclei \(A\) and \(B\).
